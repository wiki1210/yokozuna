Stable tag: 0.6.1

Add extra functionality to default search box using jQuery.

== Description ==

This plugin was completely rebuilt from the ground up on August 21, 2012. It now works using the placeholder attribute.

This plugin adds an options page to change the default text that shows in a search field. If your theme's search input already uses a placeholder, this will change it. If your theme does not use a placeholder, this will add one with javascript. It also adds IE support for the placeholder attribute. Default text will start showing up in IE once you activate this plugin.
